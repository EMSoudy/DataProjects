# Prothrombin Time in Full-Term and Premature Infants
 
Using RStudio, this project shows the statistical analysis of prothrombin time in 60 full term and premature infants, randomly sampled from a population of 1000 infants. Each population includes 500 infants. 30 infants randomly sampled subjects from each population. Each population of randomly sampled infants were analyzed against each other, as well as the total populations.
 
This project includes:
  - Statistical analysis
     - Hypothesis testing/confidence level
     - Grubbs tests (outlier testing)
  - Graphical analysis
     - Plot Graphs and Boxplots
 - PDF presentation
 
Background:   

 -  Prothrombin time (PT)- the amount of time it takes for blood to form a clot
   
     - If clotting factor levels are too low, infant is at risk of dangerous blood clotting in arteries/veins
     - If clotting factor levels are too high, infant is at risk of excessive bleeding
    
Hypothesis:

 - Null hypthesis: There is no difference in the means of prothrombin time between full term and premature infants
  
  - Alternate hypthothesis: The means of PT between full term and premature infants significantly different.

Grubbs Tests (Outliers)
- 1 outlier was detected in the sample of premature infants and was removed to maintain the integrity of the data
  - this decreased the premature infant sample population to 29. Outlier was not replaced.
- Premature infants are more likely to have irregular (outliers) PT than full term infants

Statistical Analystis:

- Graphical and Descriptive Statistics:

     -  Conclude that premature infants are more likely to have higher and abnormal PT than full term infants

- Student's t-test / 10 Step Hypothosis
      - The Student's t-test is used to test the hypothesis that separate populations have equal means by using the p-value
      - The 10 Step Hypothesis was the more prominent and detailed way to test the hypothesis by using the t-value
     -  Both hypothesis tests conclude that the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternate hypothesis is accepted that there is a significant difference in the means of the two populations

Conclusion 
 - There is a significant difference between the PT of full term and premature infants

Key Findings
- PT for full term infants is typically lower than premature infants
- Premature infants may be more susceptible to experiencing complications of the coagulation system than full term infants
