# Prothrombin Time in Full-Term and Premature Infants
 
This project shows the statistical analysis through Rstudio of prothrombin time in 60 full term and premature infants, randomly sampled from a population of 1000 infants. Each population includes 500 infants. 30 infants randomly sampled subjects from each population. Each population of randomly sampled infants were analyzed against each other, as well as the total populations.
 
This project includes:
  - Statistical analysis
     - Hypothesis testing/confidence level
     - Grubbs tests (outlier testing)
  - Graphical analysis
     - Plot Graphs and Boxplots
 - PDF presentation
 
Background:   

  Prothrombin time - the amount of time it takes for blood to form a clot
   
   - If clotting factor levels are too low, infant is at risk of dangerous blood clotting in arteries/veins
   - If clotting factor levels are too high, infant is at risk of excessive bleeding
    
Hypothesis:

 - Null hypthesis: There is no difference in the means of prothrombin time between full term and premature infants
  
  - Alternate hypthothesis: The means of prothrombin time between full term and premature infants significantly different.
